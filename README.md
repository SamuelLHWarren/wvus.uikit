===================

This self-containing kit is the basis of World Vision US website styling.

### Getting Started
* Clone the repo: `git@github.com:wvus-ibu/wvus.uikit.git`
* Production ready files are located in the css, img, and js folders
* To customize, modify the JS and LESS files under the src/lib folder then run `grunt` in src folder to compile

### Contents
The World Vision UiKit is built on top of Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).

The source of these libraries can be found in the src/lib folder.

1. Install the [Node Package Manager (npm)](http://nodejs.org/download/)
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) using `npm install -g grunt-cli`
That will allow the World Vision US UiKit to be compiled
